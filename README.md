# Animejs website


[Link to the website](https://marked-birds.surge.sh/)

This website was made using animejs package. My first inspiration fro the website was to create a breathing website that is part of meditation. 

Inspiration was this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/l-1ZrU6avzI?si=JOP6LNXqp_TQhL3j) that I did a while ago. 

My animation for the breathing in and breathing out was made with animejs package. I used grid of circles that scales the circles when the user breathes in and scales down when the user breathes out. Each aprt of the cycle(breathe in, hold, breathe out, hold) last for 4 seconds. 

**Packages that i used:**
1. Animejs
2. Vanilla Javascirpt

**Future implementations:**

I would add a variety of animations a user can choose for the breathing medidation.
